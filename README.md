# Book Recommendation System Based on Collaborative Filtering

Project Overview
-------------------
This project aims to design and implement a book recommendation system using a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm. The system analyzes user reading behavior to create personalized book recommendations. Developed using Python and Django, the system includes features such as user registration, login, book search, book rating, and personalized recommendations based on reading preferences.

Features
----------------------------
1. User Registration and Authentication
Users can register, log in, and manage their accounts.
2. Book Search and Filtering
Users can search for books by keywords and filter by categories.
3. Book Recommendation
The system provides personalized book recommendations using collaborative filtering.
4. Book Rating and Reviews
Users can rate books and write reviews, which further improves recommendation accuracy.
5. Admin Management
Admins can manage users, books, ratings, and reviews through a dedicated dashboard.

System Design
--------------------------
1. Frontend and Backend Architecture
The system follows an MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern using the Django framework.
2. Database Design
The backend uses MySQL for storing user data, books, ratings, and interactions.
The database schema includes tables for users, books, ratings, comments, and book categories.
3. Recommendation Algorithm
The user-based collaborative filtering algorithm calculates the similarity between users based on their ratings to recommend books.
